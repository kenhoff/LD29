I'm in. My main goal for this compo is to strictly only use C# with Unity. I've been a Unity developer for years, but I've only used Javascript and I've begun to run into technical limitations.

Tool list:

 - Engine: Unity
 - Editor: Sublime, most likely with Vintageous
 - Art: Procreate for iPad
 - Sound: Bfxr, audacity, whatever samples aren't too outrageous
 - Timelapse: Chronolapse
 - Version control: Git, Github
 - Sustenance: Tomato soup, crusty bread, chai, lots of fruit
 - Working music: Beatbuddy Soundtrack on endless repeat

That's all I can think of for now. Best of luck to all entrants!
