> Here's the post that I published on the Ludum Dare blog!

I'm in. My main goal for this compo is to strictly only use C# with Unity. I've been a Unity developer for years, but I've only used Javascript and I've begun to run into technical limitations.

Tool list:

 - Engine: Unity
 - Editor: Sublime, most likely with Vintageous
 - Art: Procreate for iPad
 - Sound: Bfxr, audacity, whatever samples aren't too outrageous
 - Timelapse: Chronolapse
 - Version control: Git, Github
 - Sustenance: Tomato soup, crusty bread, chai, lots of fruit
 - Working music: Beatbuddy Soundtrack on endless repeat

That's all I can think of for now. Best of luck to all entrants!

> Beneath the Surface

The theme got announced while I was in the middle of a Binding of Isaac game, so I finished that while letting the theme run on a mental background process. Lost on the final stage of Satan (arrrrgh)

First things that came to mind were 2D-side scroller sea game. Just like Aquaria, Beatbuddy, those sort of games. I remember a while back that there was a simple flash game titled "Moby Dick." The premise behind it was that someone had written a game about Moby Dick without reading the book and having a very limited idea of what it was about. It consisted of a white whale swimming around the sea absolutely wrecking every bit of sailor and ship it could find. Totally silly, tons of fun.

A track came to mind as soon as I heard the theme, too. "Orange's Kiss," off the Castle Crashers soundtrack, has that super-cheesy maritime theme in it, and I'm definetely using it as placeholder music for the time being.

I'm thinking a spiritual successor to that Moby Dick game, a la Luftrausers. Your submarine turns towards the mouse cursor, right click to go, left click to shoot. Collect upgrades for your health, weapons and engines, and fight other submarines, destroyers, carriers, getting shot at with torpeoes, depth charges, harpoons, kamikaze seagulls, that sort of thing.

I don't want it to be a direct rip, though. There's gotta be something else that I can include to really make it different. Hmmm....
